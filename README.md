# NIBSS_AES_PHP
Implementation of NIBSS (Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System) for Complex Biller Encryption & Decryption with PHP Implementation.

The Cipher mode is AES-128-CBC with Base64 and Hexadecimal.

Example of how to use The ENCRYPT and DECRYPT are on the 'tester.php' file,  for simplicity sake. Nothing else for you to do, just replace your keys (key & IV) on the file and run your code. Leave your comments and questions, I will try to attend to them.

Here is a link to the JAVA implementation: https://github.com/kelvinsaghayedo/NIBSS_AES_JAVA
